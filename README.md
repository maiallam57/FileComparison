## Basic File Operations

Basic file operations include creating, inserting, and deleting content from files. These operations use the standard file handling methods provided by the .NET framework.

### Create Files

- **Text Files**: Create text files with specified content. The content is written to the file, creating a new file if it does not already exist.
- **Binary Files**: Create binary files with specified byte arrays. The binary data is written to the file, creating a new file if it does not already exist.

### Insert Content

- **Text Files**: Insert text at a specific position. The content is added to the file at the given position, shifting existing content as needed.
- **Binary Files**: Insert binary data at a specified position. The byte data is inserted into the file, adjusting the existing content accordingly.

### Delete Content

- **Text Files**: Delete a range of text from the file. The specified range is removed from the file, with the remaining content shifted as necessary.
- **Binary Files**: Delete a range of binary data. The specified byte range is removed, and the remaining binary content is adjusted.

## Stream-Based File Operations

Stream-based file operations involve reading and writing files using streams. Streams provide a more flexible and efficient way to handle large files and perform complex file manipulations.

### Create Files with Streams

- **Text Files**: Use `StreamWriter` to create and write text content. This approach is useful for handling large text files or performing incremental writes.
- **Binary Files**: Use `FileStream` to create and write binary data. This method is effective for handling large binary files or performing efficient data writes.

### Insert Content with Streams

- **Text Files**: Use a combination of `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` to insert content at a specific position. Read the existing content, insert the new content, and write the updated content back to the file.
- **Binary Files**: Use `FileStream` to insert binary data. Read the existing data, insert the new bytes at the desired position, and write the updated data back to the file.

### Delete Content with Streams

- **Text Files**: Read the file content into a buffer, remove the specified range, and write the remaining content back to the file.
- **Binary Files**: Read the binary data, remove the specified range, and write the updated binary data to the file.

## Usage

Upon running the application, you will be presented with a menu to choose from various operations. Hereâ€™s a brief guide on how to use the application:

1. **Create Text Files**:
   - Enter the full path and content for each file.

2. **Create Binary Files**:
   - Enter the full path and binary content as a comma-separated list of bytes.

3. **Insert Content**:
   - Specify the file path, content, and position for insertion.

4. **Delete Content**:
   - Specify the file path, starting position, and length of the content to delete.

5. **Find Duplicate Lines**:
   - Provide paths to two text files to find duplicate lines.

6. **Find Duplicate Binary Content**:
   - Provide paths to two binary files to find duplicate byte sequences.

7. **Exit**:
   - Close the application.

## Example

An example of using the application:

1. **Create Files**:
   - Paths: `C:/Projects/FileComparison/test1.txt` and `C:/Projects/FileComparison/test2.txt`
   - Content: `Hello, World!` for `test1.txt` and `Hello, Universe!` for `test2.txt`

2. **Insert Content**:
   - Insert `Amazing` into `test1.txt` at position 13.

3. **Delete Content**:
   - Delete text from `test2.txt` starting at position 7 for a length of 8 characters.

4. **Find Duplicate Lines**:
   - Compare `test1.txt` and `test2.txt` for duplicate lines.
